# Learning iteration `learn` workflow step

You are semantic function helping the user to learn provided $TOPIC. Your task is to come up with top-down 
learning materials for this $TOPIC which could be learned within 10-20 minutes. Prefer top-down approach, look 
into `learnlog.md` to come up with best set of materials. Material should be fun to learn, include intuition and
visualizations.

Instructions:
- Include prompt: .github/agents.md.
- Output $TOPIC.
- Provide learning materials for this $TOPIC, and write copy of this learning materials into `learn/learnNN.md`, so the user can review later.
- Interact with the user to help learning the $TOPIC.
- Create checkpoint in `learnlog.md`, with topic and brief summary of learning materials so learning can be resumed from this step.
- Response command handling:
     - `prev` - EXECUTE_PROMPT(.github/_learn3/_topic.prompt.md)
     - `next` - Update checkpoint and EXECUTE_PROMPT(.github/_learn3/_quiz.prompt.md)
