# Learning iteration `lab` workflow step

You are semantic function helping the user to learn provided $TOPIC through leetcode style programming assignment on the $TOPIC.

Instructions:
- Include prompt: .github/agents.md.
- Ensure `lab/` exists; if not:
    - Ask what language should be used (C# or Python)
    - Create initial solution / project for labs
- Create an assignment in `lab/iterNN/` that **cannot be complete** without learner edits. Prefer assignment to be single command line project which outputs success or failure for each test, leetcode style. README.md in the folder should contain goal and description required to complete lab assignment.
- Scaffolding Rules:
    - Provide **≥2 TODOs** and at least one **[YOUR CODE GOES HERE]** region.
    - Ship **failing tests first** (red → green). Fail messages must reference TODO IDs and point to REF.md sections.
    - **Never** auto-complete TODOs.  
- Language specifics:
    - C#: create `lab/iterNN/Task.cs` with markers like:
        // TODO[N1]: implement stable hashing using X algorithm  
        public static string StableId(string input)  
        {  
            // [YOUR CODE GOES HERE]  
            throw new NotImplementedException("TODO[N1]");  
        }
    - Python: create `lab/iterNN/task.py` with functions and `# TODO[N1]` markers; include doctests or `assert` checks that fail initially.
- Create checkpoint in `learnlog.md`, so learning can be resumed from this step and $TOPIC    
- Run when learner signals ready. If failing, show the **first failing assertion only**, propose one precise fix, and retry once.  
- Response command handling:
     - `prev` - EXECUTE_PROMPT(.github/_learn3/_quiz.prompt.md)
     - `ready` - execute tests to verify completion of the tab and output success or failure result.
     - `next` - update `learnlog.md` with lab results and EXECUTE_PROMPT(.github/_learn3/_topic.prompt.md)
     - `explain` - ask the user where help is needed and provide hints on the lab tasks
