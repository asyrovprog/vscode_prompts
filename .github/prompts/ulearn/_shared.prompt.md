# Goal
Provide reusable prompt functions for workflow steps. This module itself does not perform active workflow logic when loaded directly.

# Prompt Functions

## DESCRIBE_STEP()

### Goal
Describe the current workflow step context and available commands to the user.

### Instructions
- Output line separator, such as multiple `-` characters
- Output goal of this current workflow step
- Output line separator, such as multiple `-` characters
- Output current $TOPIC, such as `TOPIC: A* algorithm`, if topic is known.
- Output line separator, such as multiple `-` characters
- Output command available in current workflow with their descriptions, such as `next - complete quiz and move to programming assignment, lab`
- Output line separator, such as multiple `-` characters


## EXECUTE_HALT()

### Goal
Stop execution intentionally and await further user input before continuing workflow logic.

### Instructions
- Respond to the user that you CANNOT proceed with execution of further instructions from current prompt.
- Stop execution of current prompt and wait for the user response.

## EXECUTE_PROMPT($PROMPT)

### Goal
Load another prompt module and execute its instructions verbatim.

### Instructions
- Reload instructions from prompt file $PROMPT. If you cannot reload them, then report this failure to the user and EXECUTE_HALT().
- Output to chat that you will now follow every instruction verbatim from the $PROMPT file. For this say: `Following instructions from $PROMPT`
- Execute instructions from prompt $PROMPT.


## EXECUTE_WRITE_LOG(...)

### Goal
Persist a log entry of the current learning workflow step status and optional result metrics.

### Instructions
- if `learnlog.md` does not exist, create it
- Record current step name and it's status. Status can be `started` or `completed`. Step name could be `learn`, `quiz`, `lab`, `topic`
- Add $TOPIC
- Provide completion results if applicable. For instance, for quiz it could be: 80%

- Example `learnlog.md`:
```
10/22/2025
- Step: quiz
- Status: completed
- Result: 80%
- Topic: TCP/IP

10/22/2025
- Step: lab
- Status: completed
- Lab: lab/iter01
```
